Other data sources
==================

Atlite was originally designed to be modular, so that it can work with
other weather datasets.
The current version v0.2 of Atlite uses by default the ERA5 dataset and
can download the required data automatically.

A note on datasets
------------------
The current version v0.2 of Atlite does only support ERA5 as a data source.
Previous versions supported also: *NCEP Climate Forecast System*,
*EURO-CORDEX Cliamte Change Projection*, *CMSAF SARAH-2*.

If you need to process these (or other) data sources, feel free to
file an issue on our `GitHub <https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite>`_ or (even better) create a pull request!
