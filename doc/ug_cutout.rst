It can process the following weather data fields:

* Temperature
* Downward short-wave radiation
* Upward short-wave radiation
* Wind 
* Runoff
* Surface roughness
* Height maps
* Soil temperature

The following power-system relevant time series can be produced for
all possible spatial distributions of assets:

* Wind power generation for a given turbine type
* Solar PV power generation for a given panel type
* Solar thermal collector heat output
* Hydroelectric inflow (simplified)
* Heating demand (based on the degree-day approximation)
