  abstract = {fon: 0055 48 331 9379 216, fax: 0055 48 2345119 \# meteocontrol GMbH, Stadtj\"agerstrasse 11, Augsburg,Germany. Introduction The EU-funded Project PVSat-2 aims at further development of procedures for the performance check of grid-connected PV-systems based on remotely sensed radiation data. Within this procedure a simple, but sufficiently performing model for the estimation of the MPP power output based on information of the irradiance input and the ambient temperature is required. Whereas in the forerunner of this project, PVSat, main emphasis was put on the modelling of modules with cells of the crystalline Silicon (cSi) type, PVSat-2 should cover the whole range of different cell technologies. Thus a model, able to reflect the efficiency characteristics of both the classic crystalline silicon and the various thin film technologies is required. In view of the handling of a big number of systems, the additional requirements to the model are the need of a restricted number of device specific input parameters only together with the ease of their determination. Looking for improvements of the performance check of PV-Systems within the PVSat-2 project To assure the maximal energy yield of grid connected PV systems, system faults have to be identified as quickly as possible. For this task several procedures that offer an almost continuous performance check are in development or application (see e.g. [1], [2]). They are mostly based on the identification of reference values of the performance that are estimated from information on the meteorological conditions (irradiance, temperature) that may either be gained by on site measurements or be remotely sensed, i.e. derived from the images of meteorological satellites. Within the project PVSat-2 (see. [3]), a continuation of the PVSat project [1] funded by the European commission, a respective procedure based on remotely sensed hourly irradiance data is subject to further improvements. One field of improvements is the modelling of the performance of the generators. Whereas in PVSat, main emphasis was put on the modelling of modules with cells of the crystalline Silicon (cSi) type, PVSat-2 aims to cover the whole range of different cell technologies. Thus a model, able to reflect the efficiency characteristics of both the classic crystalline silicon and the various thin film technologies is required. In the following a simple procedure for the estimation of the efficiency of PV-generators operated under MPP conditions in dependence of irradiance and module temperature {$\eta$}(G,T) is proposed. The application of this model is tested for Generators with cells made of crystalline silicon (cSi), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and copper-indium-diselenite (CIS).},

  abstract = {A clear consensus exists in the German society that renewable energies have to play a dominant role in the future German energy supply system. However, many questions are still under discussion; for instance the relevance of the different technologies such as photovoltaic systems and wind energy converters installed offshore in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Also concerns exist about the cost of a future energy system mainly based on renewable energies. In order to be able to address the raised issues on a scientifically sound basis we have set up a new simulation model REMod-D (Renewable Energy Model-Deutschland) that models the energy balance of the electricity and heat sector including all renewable energy converters, storage components and loads for a future German energy system for a whole year based on an hourly energy balance. The target energy systems modeled use a high fraction up to 100\% of renewable energies to cover the electricity and heat demand (heating and hot water). The model includes also energy retrofit of buildings as a measure to reduce future heat loads of the building sector. A mathematical\textendash numerical optimizer is applied in order to identify system configurations with minimal overall annual cost. In this first part of a two-paper series we describe the methodology of the REMod-D model and discuss cost and performance values of all included components and in the second part we will discuss the results.},

In this work, the theory of Bayesian inference will be presented at length. The Bayesian analysis consists in two levels. The first one is related to the parameter estimation while the second one concerns the model selection problem. As an illustration, a Bayesian parameter estimation method is used to derive a logistic hourly solar diffuse fraction model. A major difference between Bayesian and frequentist (or classical) methods is that the Bayesian inference offers a framework (through the use of prior information) to continuously update our posterior beliefs. In other words, all previous work is not wasted as the preceding model's parameters can be used as prior information for the derivation of the parameters estimates of the next (new) model. For this particular application, it is also shown that the use of Bayesian methods instead of classical statistical techniques lead to a less biased model.},

  abstract = {Despite significant recent advancements, global hydrological models and their input databases still show limited capabilities in supporting many spatially detailed research questions and integrated assessments, such as required in freshwater ecology or applied water resources management. In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced HydroSHEDS layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model (HydroROUT) that is currently under development. The resulting `hydro-spatial fabric' is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

Among the popular renewables, hydroelectricity shows unique storage-like flexibility, which is particularly important given the high variability of wind and solar power. Often limited by data availability or computational performance, a high resolution, globally applicable and validated hydro power time series model has not been available. For a demonstration, we focus on 41 Chinese reservoir-based hydro stations as a demo, determine their upstream basin areas, estimate their inflow based on gridded surface runoff data and validate their daily inflow time series in terms of both flow volume and potential power generation. Furthermore, we showcase an application of these time series with hydro cascades in energy system long term investment planning. Our method's novelty lies in:it is based on highly resolved spatial-temporal datasets; both data and algorithms used here are globally applicable; it includes a hydro cascade model that can be integrated into energy system simulations.},

It uses the same approach as an earlier paper by Walraven, but has a more simplified form. This subject of the calculation of the solar position is revisited because of the somewhat confusing sequence of notes and letters that followed Walraven's publication in this journal and because of a report challenging the accuracy claimed by him. The Almanac approximation is compared to exact values and to some commonly used approximations. An appendix contains an annotated subroutine in FORTRAN, which should be easily converted to other programming languages.},

The goal is to determine if other predictor variables, in addition to the clearness index, will significantly educe the standard error of Liu- and Jordan-type correlations (IdI = f(k1)). Stepwise regression is used to reduce a set of 28 potential predictor variables down to four significant predictors: the clearness index, solar altitude, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. A piecewise correlation over three ranges of clearness indices is developed to predict the diffuse fraction as a function of these four variables. A second piecewise correlation is developed for predicting the diffuse fraction as a function of the clearness index and solar altitude, for use when temperature and relative humidity are not available. A third piecewise correlation of the Liu- and Jordan-type is developed from the same data set. Comparing this correlation with the new correlations provides a direct measure of the value of added predictor variables. The full diffuse fraction correlation reduced the residual sum squares by 14\% when compared to the correlation that is a function of the clearness index only. The correlation including the clearness index and solar altitude diminished the residual sum squares by 9\%. The correlations exhibited some degree of location dependence. This is expected, as the climates are quite different. The correlations also showed some seasonal dependence; the errors are higher in the fall and winter than on an annual basis.},

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing {NASA}'s {MERRA} and {MERRA}-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},
